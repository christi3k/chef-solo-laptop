Arduino
=======

This cookbook installs a modern (>= 22) version of [Ardiuno][1].

It follows the installation as described in the walkthrough
"[Getting started with Arduino Uno on Ubuntu][2]" and
"[Install the Arduino IDE in Ubuntu 12.04][3]". Further inspiration
is taken from "[Our First Chef Cookbook][4]".
