Chef Solo Laptop
================

This repository contains chef cookbooks and recipes for the provision
of my laptop.

Chef
----

[Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/ "Chef homepage") provides a means
to provision a (cluster of) machine.

Because we do not want to depend on a chef-server we opt to use the
[chef-solo](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo "Documentation about chef solo")
instance.

Procedure
---------

In this section the procedure for getting the provision of a laptop up
and running is described here. The assumptions made are summarized in
a list at the end of the procedure.

### Ubuntu

Install the latest version of 
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ "Homepage of Ubuntu"). When this
procudure was described the latest version was Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
Precise Pangolin.
